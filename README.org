* speaker swarm
the idea is to have all websocket clients act as a sound system (lol) by playing audio in sync

** MVP
- [ ] play button starts mp3 on all clients simultaneously

* notes
Two ways to synchronise client audio
1. clients each open their own stream and synchronize by communicating
2. all clients join the same stream (server streams out audio) - clients just join in

No idea which is more fruitful for actually playing audio in sync - option 1. is more desirable
because the server doesn't need to do anything but relay messages between clients - that means ppl can use their own
accounts (e.g. spotify) and the server doesn't have to expose our accounts to the world. So let's start with option 1.

* ideas
- soundboard \\
  wait for all clients to fetch mp3 before play
- spotify
